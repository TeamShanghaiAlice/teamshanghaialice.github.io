# [转]Listen中英文歌词 #

			Listen 歌手：Beyonce Knowles

Listen To the song here in my heart
听 我发自内心的声音

A melody I start but can't complete
一段我能开头却无法结束的旋律

Listen (mmm) To the sound from deep within
听 那是我内心的声音

It's only beginning to find release
是我找到解脱之路的开端

Oh, the time has come For my dreams to be heard
那是我的梦想终能被倾听的时刻

They will not be pushed aside and turned
他再也不会被推到一边

Into your own, all 'cause you won’t listen
改造成你的梦想 因为你永远也不会倾听

Listen I am alone at a crossroads
听着 我独自站在十字路口

I'm not at home in my own home
我不在属于自己的归所

And I've tried and tried To say what's on my mind
我试着说出真心话

You should have known
你早该知道的话

Oh, now I'm done believing you
我不再相信你了
You don't know what I'm feeling
不从不知我心中感受

I'm more than what you made of me
我比你所创造的我更多

I followed the voice you gave to me
我追寻你所给我的声音

But now I've got to find my own
但现在我要开始寻找自我

You should have listened
你该倾听的

There is someone here inside
这里面住着一个人
Someone I thought had died so long ago
一个我以为早已离去的人

Oh, I'm screamin out And my dreams will be heard
我真心祈祷 我的梦想将被听见

They will not be pushed aside or worse
他将不会再被推翻到一边

Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
改造成你的梦想 只因你不愿倾听

Listen I am alone at a crossroads
听着 我独自站在十字路口

I'm not at home in my own home
我不在属于自己的归所

And I've tried and tried To say what's on my mind
我试着说出真心话

You should have known Oh,
你早该知道的话

Now I'm done believing you
我不再相信你了

You don't know what I'm feeling
你从不知我心中感受

I'm more than what you made of me
不我比你所创造的我更多

I followed the voice you gave to me
我追寻着你所给我的声音

But now I've got to find my own
但现在我要开始找寻自我

I don't know where I belong
我不知我将身在何方

But I'll be moving on
但将坚持前进方向

If you don't, if you won't
如果你仍不愿倾听

Listen To the song here in my heart
听着 我心中的歌

A melody I start but I will complete
一段我开始的旋律 但我一定会完成

Oh, now I'm done believing you
我不再相信你了

You don't know what I'm feeling
你从不知我心中感受

I'm more than what you made of me
我比你所创造的我更多

I followed the voice you think you gave to me
我找到你所给我的声音

But now I've got to find my own, my own
但现在我要开始寻找自我
